Small Java Games created for / during different Java Classes

Over time I've written a variety of Java games during the java classes that I've taught at M.U.M. 

Unfortunately I seem to have lost at least one of them (a breakout clone with menus). And so I've
deceided to try and collect as many as I can find and store them here.
